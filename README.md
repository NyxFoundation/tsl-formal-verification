# Formal Verification of Top Single Layer (TSL)

Formal verification project for the Top Single Layer (TSL) encoding method from the paper “At the Top of the Hypercube — Better Size-Time Tradeoffs for Hash-Based Signatures” (ePrint 2025/889).

- Formal proofs are written in Lean 4.
- Informal write‑ups live alongside as Markdown and are kept consistent with the accepted formal results.
- A DDD‑style CLI (Node.js + Prisma) manages the Focal (Artifact) Theorem, its Focal Stub Lemmas, unified proposition state, and turn records.
